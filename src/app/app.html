      Maisy Miles is where atomic flair meets folk art enchantment. We're a
      husband-and-wife team from a small town in southwest Michigan, just a
      stone's throw from the shores of Lake Michigan. Inspired by the sleek
      lines and bold colors of 1950s mid-century modern fashion and the
      whimsical charm of Scandinavian folk design, each piece is a little work
      of wearable (or hangable) art. From statement earrings to one-of-a-kind
      ornaments, every design blends retro cool with a touch of magic- made to
      bring joy, spark conversation, and turn everyday moments into something
      extraordinary.
